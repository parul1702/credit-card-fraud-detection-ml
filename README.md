# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the highly imbalanced **Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal is to build a model that can **accurately identify fraudulent transactions**, even with significant class imbalance, using data preprocessing, resampling techniques, and classifiers.
